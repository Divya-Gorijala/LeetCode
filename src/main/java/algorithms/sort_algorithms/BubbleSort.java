//Best Case: If the array is already sorted, the algorithm will terminate after just one pass
// with no swaps, resulting in a time complexity of O(n). Worst Case: For an unsorted array, it
// will still have a time complexity of O(n^2), but the optimization reduces the number of
// unnecessary passes.
